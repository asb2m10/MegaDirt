# MegaDirt
MegaDirt is a re-implementation of [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) for [TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal). It is meant to be run into a DAW as a plugin.

*MegaDirt is a proof of concept, use at your own risk. It expect to use the Dirt-Sample downloaded from SuperDirt quark directory.*

Main advantage of MegaDirt over SuperDirt
* Easier installation
* Easier audio routing from DAW, route orbits dynamically, create buses on the fly
* Easier midi routing from DAW
* TidalCycle events can be in sync with the DAW timeline
